# This file is your local configuration file and is where all local user settings
# are placed. The comments in this file give some guide to the options a new user
# to the system might want to change but pretty much any configuration option can
# be set in this file. More adventurous users can look at
# local.conf.sample.extended which contains other examples of configuration which
# can be placed in this file but new users likely won't need any of them
# initially.
